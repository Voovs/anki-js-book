While there aren't many, there are a few articles concerning JS in Anki. We used
some of these in the guidebook, though it may be helpful to look at the
originals as well

[This post on Anki

provides an excellent starting guide to event-listeners and the DOM

Wondering how to load in a JS library or CSS framework? The Anki forum has an
[excellent

just for that. Unless your script is immensely long or a library is
indispensable, it's safer to stick with inline-JS as we do here



[This Github
Gist](https://gist.github.com/silas/3d28414a3ef27890603fc9c26348cf2f) gives a
step-by-step setup guide to start using JS. However their coding practices are
exemplary of what we warned against in [chapter
