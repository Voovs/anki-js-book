# Workshop Overview

To get some practice writing Javascript in Anki cards, we'll go through some
examples workshop style. You're encouraged to make a new card type and follow
along!

## Setup
You'll need an editor set up and should have read the [basics section](/anki_js/basics.md) first. Even
if this is your first time writing Javascript, this workshop will be easy to
understand. Remember to search up anything you don't understand

Our first few projects will be quite simple and useful. We'll then scale up to
somewhat more complicated situations and wrap up with an unrealistic example
that'll make you an expert at JS in Anki

The first chapter in each set of workshops has code for you to copy and paste
into template fields. You'll want to make a new card type for this, just to make
sure we don't mess up any of your current decks

The default templates assume you're using dark mode. Either switch to dark mode
in "Preferences" -> "Basic" -> "Night Mode" or change the color variables in the
Styling pane
